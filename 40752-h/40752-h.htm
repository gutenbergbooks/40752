<img src="images/illus006_w.png" width="150" height="112" alt="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HAT a glad noise there was that Christmas
morning! The children had got up early
to look in their stockings. John's were
not quite large enough to hold all of his
gifts. It is rather hard to crowd a sword,
a gun, and a rocking-horse all into one stocking.</div>

<p>Mary had a fine new doll. Harry had a box, and, on
taking off the cover, up sprang a wise-looking little man,
with a cap on his head. Jessy had a doll, and a very
pretty one it was too. Tommy had a what-do-you-call-it.
Why did he look up the chimney? I think it was to see
if there was any sign of Santa Claus.</p>

<p>John mounted his horse, waved his sword, and held up
his gun. But very soon he began to get tired of them all.
The thought came into his head that he was more than
eight years old. "What do I want of these toys?" said
he. "Why was I so silly as to choose them, when aunt
Susan would have given me a microscope?" And John
laid down his sword and gun, feeling quite above such
childish things.</p>

<p>When aunt Susan came, she saw that John did not seem
as glad over his presents as the rest of the children did
over theirs. "What is the matter, John?" she asked.
"Why are you not playing with your toys?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Susan," said John, "I wish I had taken the
microscope. Is it too late?"</p>

<p>"No, John. I thought you might repent your choice,
so I said to Mr. Grover, who keeps the toy-shop, 'I think
I shall want to change the microscope: can I do so?' He
said, 'Yes.' His shop will be open till eleven o'clock. So
run round and get the microscope, and tell him to send
to-morrow and take back the toys."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>In five seconds John had on his hat, and was running
down the street to Mr. Grover's. He came back with the
microscope in about half an hour, and was full of joy at
the change. A merry Christmas it was then for all the
children!</p>

And I'm sad when they're sad,<br />

<br />
Whenever we walk,<br />

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />HE tenth chapter of St. John says, "He calleth his
own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. He
goeth before them, and the sheep follow him; for
they know his voice. And a stranger will they not
follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the
voice of strangers."</div>

<p>But may it not be the form or dress of the shepherd that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the sheep know, and follow him? To test this, a traveller,
who had put the question, once exchanged dresses with a
shepherd, and went amongst the sheep.</p>

<p>The traveller in the shepherd's dress called the sheep,
and tried to lead them; but "they knew not his voice," and
did not move. But when the shepherd called them, though
he was in the traveller's dress, they ran at once to him,
thus proving that it was the voice that led them.</p>

<p>I have a dog that will sometimes bark at me when I put
on an overcoat which he has not seen me wear before. But,
the moment he hears my voice, he seems ashamed of not
having known me, and will whine, as if he would say,
"Pardon me, good master. It was very stupid in me not
to know you. It was your coat I did not know. I will
try to be wiser the next time."</p>

<h2>"A FRIEND IN NEED."</h2>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ENRY lived in the great city of London. He was
known as "the boy at the crossing." He used to
sweep one of the crossings in Oxford Street. In wet
weather these crossings are very muddy. Now and
then some one would give him a penny for his work.</div>

<p>He did not make much in a day; but what he got was a
great help to his mother. That thought kept him daily at
his work. One day he saw a little girl trying to lead her
little brother across the street. The carts and the horses
made her afraid, and she ran back timidly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, little girl?" asked Henry.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we shall be run over," said the girl.</p>

<p>"I'll help you across," said Henry. Then, lifting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
little boy in his arms, he took the girl by the hand, and led
her safely to the other side of the street.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said the little girl; and "Thank you!"
said her little brother, as plainly as he could speak it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>I went up and asked the boy with the broom if he knew
the children. "I never saw them before in my life," said
he; "but such little ones can't get across without help."</p>

<p>"You are a good boy," said I. "I think you must have
a good father."</p>

<p>"I had one once," said he; "but now I have only a good
mother."</p>

<p>"Well, Henry," said I, "give her this shilling, and tell
her I send it to her for teaching her boy to do good when
he can get a chance."</p>

<p>Tears came to the boy's eyes. A shilling seemed a good
deal of money to him, and it pleased him all the more
because it was given him for his mother.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; thank you!" said he, and he ran back
to his work one of the happiest boys in London, I think, at
that moment.</p>

<h2>DOWN THE RIVER AFTER THE
BOY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;">
<img src="images/drop_w.png" width="82" height="150" alt="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />ALTER DALE was a little boy six years old, who
lived with his parents on the bank of the River
Thames in England. One day, after dinner, he
went to the water's edge to play.</div>

<p>Seeing a small boat tied to a big stone by a rope,
he pulled the boat up to the shore. "What a nice little
boat!" said he. "I will get into it, and rock it, as I once
saw a big boy do."</p>

<p>So he got into the boat, and began to rock it. The boat
got loose, and drifted down the river. Walter did not notice
this until he was quite a distance from the shore; then,
turning round, he saw what had happened. Every moment
the current was carrying him further from home.</p>

<p>Walter was not a timid boy, and, instead of crying, he
began to reason in this way: "The boat does not leak. It
is safe and sound. There are no waves to make me afraid.
The wind does not blow. Here on a seat is a thick blanket.
In this box is a loaf of bread and a knife. The water of
the river is good to drink, and here is a tin mug. I think
I will not cry, but hope for the best."</p>

<p>So he sat down. He called to some people on the shore;
but they did not hear him. He stood up, and waved his hat
to a man in a passing boat, and cried, "Help, help!" But
the man thought it was some little fellow making fun of
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Walter's mother had become anxious. She
ran down to the river, and followed his foot-tracks to the
edge of the water. Then she ran back to her husband; but
he was not in the house. In about an hour he came back,
and she said, "Quick, quick! Get a boat, and call John to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
help you. Walter is drifting down the river in that little
green boat, I am sure."</p>

<p>Mr. Dale ran out of the house, called his man John, and
they went down to the bank. Here they took a good fast
boat, pulled it out into the stream, and began to row with
the current.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus019.png" width="500" height="268" alt="A boat with two men in it" />
</div>

<p>It was getting late. A mist was creeping over the great
city of London. They could hardly see the tall stores, the
masts and steeples on one side. But on they went, rowing
swiftly with their good oars, as if for dear life.</p>

<p>They looked out sharply on both sides to catch a sight of
the little green boat. At last, when they had rowed about
two miles, with the tide in their favor, Mr. Dale cried out,
"I see it! I see it! But, ah! it is empty. I see no sign
of a boy in it. What can have become of poor Walter?"</p>

<p>On they rowed, and at last came up with the boat. Still
no Walter was to be seen. The poor father was in despair,
when all at once Walter started up from under the great
blanket, where he had been hiding. He cried out, "Here I
am, papa, safe and sound!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you little rogue! Come here and let me pull your
ears!" They all got back to their home in time for a late
tea, which mother had kept warm for them. Walter was
kissed and then cuffed; but the cuffs were so tender, that
they made him laugh even more than the kisses.</p>

<h2>JACK THE MAGPIE.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 62px;">
<img src="images/drop_o.png" width="62" height="150" alt="O" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />NE day last summer, a man in Colorado found a
magpie by the roadside. Its wings had been clipped,
so that it could not fly. The man gave it to a little
boy named Ernest Hart.</div>

<p>He lived with his parents in a neat cottage near
by a mountain stream. He ran home, and showed the bird
to his sister Edith. They named it Jack.</p>

<p>Jack was quite a large bird. His body was black as coal;
his breast was white; and his wings and tail shaded off into
a dark green. His bill was long and very strong. He had
a shrewd, knowing look. As he was quite tame, he must
have been some one's pet.</p>

<p>He would hop and strut around in such a funny, pompous
way, that one could not help laughing. He would take food
from any one's hand, but would not let any one touch him,
except Mr. Hart, the children's father.</p>

<p>To Mr. Hart he seemed to take a great liking. He would
hop on to his hand or shoulder: he would follow him all
over the place. As soon as Mr. Hart came into the house,
Jack would stand outside the door, and scream to him to
come out. Indeed, Jack was almost too fond of him.</p>

<p>One day when Mr. Hart was chopping wood, Jack kept
laying his bill within two or three inches of the place
where the axe fell. It seemed just as if he wanted his
bill chopped off.</p>

<p>Jack could talk a little. He could say "pretty," "what,"
and "yes, sir." When hungry, he would come round to the
kitchen-door. There he would keep up a loud chattering,
till food was given him to eat.</p>

<p>Jack was shy of Marcus, the dog. But, while Marcus was
eating his dinner, Jack would steal up, and seize a bone from
the plate. Then he would run off and hide it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe that all magpies are thieves. I know that Jack
was a sad thief. He would carry off almost any thing he
saw lying about. One day he was caught in the act of
carrying off the gardener's pipe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus024.png" width="500" height="451" alt="Dog barking at a magpie" />
</div>

<p>It was fun for Ernest and Edith to watch him at his
mischief. All summer they made much of him. Now, in
October, though the trees are still green and the wild flowers
are not gone, we have had in our Colorado home a taste of
winter.</p>

<p>The ground has been white with snow. Jack is still with
us, and seems quite happy. Edith and Ernest may stay
here all winter. Perhaps I may tell you something of their
winter sports. Would you like to hear it?</p>

this cold winter day? Whose sweet, merry,
roguish face is this? She is wrapped up warm;
she has gloves on her hands, and a nice thick hood

<p>It is my niece Clara. She has been out with her brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and the men to gather holly and evergreen for Christmas.
First they cut down a little pine for the Christmas-tree. It
was not so very little either; for it was twenty feet high.</p>

<p>There was snow on the ground, and they had a sledge on
which to pile the hemlock-boughs, the evergreens, and the
holly. Clara saw a squirrel run up a tree, and called to her
brothers to look; but they were not quick enough to see it.</p>

<p>Then she spied a hollow place by the side of a hill, and
going to look at it, she found it was a little pond of ice. It
was smooth as glass, and she and her brothers had a nice
time sliding on it.</p>

<p>Clara was sorry when it got to be twelve o'clock, and it
was time to go home. The sledge was piled up with boughs,
and the oxen wanted their dinner. Yes, they must go.</p>

<p>But when Clara was nestled in her little bed that night,
and had said her prayers, this was her thought, "Oh, I
never shall forget this happy, happy day; the bright,
bracing air, so sweet and clear; the mild, soft sunshine;
the smell of the pines; the frolic on the pond; the ride
on the sledge; the little snowbirds that came in a flock
when I began to feed them. Oh, I never shall forget it;
no, never, never-r-r, nev&mdash;;" And with this last word half
uttered, my little niece fell asleep.</p>

<p>But the basket was not so light as he
had thought. Indeed it was quite heavy.
Perhaps this was because it was full of
apples. The gardener had just picked
them from a fine old tree in the orchard.</p>

<p>Albert was a stout little fellow; but the
basket was too much for him. In trying
to lift it, he upset it; and some of the
apples rolled out down the steps as fast
as they could go. Perhaps they saw it
was a good chance to run away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />III.</div>

<p>Albert did not cry. He knew that
crying would do no good. What was
now the first thing to be done? Albert
thought for a while, and said to himself,
"The first thing to do is to set the
basket upright."</p>

<p>He did not find it hard work to do
this. All the apples had not run out.
Some were still in the basket.</p>

<p>Albert picked up one, smelt of it, and
then put it back. He next placed the
basket upright.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<div class='center'><br />IV.</div>

<p>Having done this so that the basket
stood firm, he said, "What is the next
thing to do? The next thing to do is to
put back the apples; and I am the boy
that can do it."</p>

<p>And he did it well. He did not once
think of keeping any of the apples for
himself; nor did he even take a bite of
one of them. He was a good boy, and
too honest for that.</p>

<p>If any one had said to him, "Give me
an apple," Albert would have said, "The
apples are not mine to give."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />V.</div>

<p>"Now it is all right again," said Albert.
"What next? If the basket will not let
me carry it, the basket shall carry me.
That would be fair play."</p>

<p>So he mounted the basket, as you see,
took hold of the handle with his left hand,
and cried out, "Get up, sir!" He made
believe it was a horse. "Get up, sir!"
he cried. But the horse would not move.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />VI.</div>

<p>Albert then began to shake the basket,
as if to urge it on. Ah, me! who would
have thought to see it play the gay horse
in earnest? It seemed so gentle!</p>

<p>Who would have thought to see it shy,
and kick up, and throw Albert off? But
so it did. Albert put out both hands to
save himself, but he could not keep his
seat. Over he went.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class='center'><br />VII.</div>

<p>Over went the basket. Albert, apples,
and all rolled down the steps. "Help!"
he cried. The gardener ran up to see
what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Where are my apples?" said he.
"Here!" said Albert, jumping up, for the
lucky rogue was not hurt a bit.</p>

Christmas is coming, ho, ho, and ho, ho!<br />
Now bring on your holly and do not move slow;<br />
We'll deck the whole house with the branches so green,<br />
On wall and on picture the leaves shall be seen.<br />
Oh! merry the time when we all meet together<br />
In spite of the cold, the wind, and the weather,<br />
When grandparents, uncles, and cousins we see,<br />
All gather'd around the mahogany tree.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
It stands in the hall, the mahogany tree;<br />
And very nice fruit it will bear, you'll agree;<br />
The turkeys and capons, the puddings and pies,<br />
On Christmas day feed something more than the eyes.<br />
The poor and the needy then come to our door,<br />
And carry off with them a bountiful store<br />
Of all the good things that we have for ourselves,<br />
In cupboard and cellar, on table and shelves.<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />3.</div>

<div class='poem'>
When dinner is ended, what sound do we hear<br />
From holly-deck'd parlor ring merry and clear?<br />
'Tis Uncle Tom's fiddle! the tune is a call<br />
To all the good people to come to our ball.<br />
They come, young and old, and partake of our cheer,<br />
For old Christmas comes only once in a year!<br />
Then hand up the holly, and let us prepare<br />
The house for the pleasure in which all can share.<br />
